Yes, a cluster can have worker nodes across multiple AWS regions. According to the AWS documentation, multiple availability zone clusters can only be deployed in regions with at least 3 availability zones. However, worker nodes can be distributed across multiple regions, as long as the minimum requirement of at least one worker node per availability zone is met.\\nTo create a cluster with worker nodes across multiple regions, you can use the `roa create cluster` command with the `--region` option followed by the name of the region where you want to create the cluster, and then specify the `--worker-node-count` option to specify the number of worker nodes you want to create in each region.\\nFor example, to create a cluster with 2 worker nodes in region us-east-1 and 3 worker nodes in region us-west-2, you can use the following command:\\n```terminal\\n$ rosa create cluster --cluster=mycluster --region=us-east-1 --worker-node-count=2 --region=us-west-2 --worker-node-count=3\\n```\\nI hope this helps!

Unfortunately, ROSA does not support an air-gapped, disconnected environment where the ROSA cluster does not have internet access. The ROSA cluster requires egress to the internet to access the Red Hat registry, S3, and send metrics.

Yes, node autoscaling is available in Red Hat OpenShift on AWS (ROSA). You can enable autoscaling for the default machine pool on a cluster using the `roa edit` command, as shown in the context.

The maximum number of worker nodes that a ROSA (Red Hat OpenShift on AWS) cluster can support is 180 per cluster. This information is available in the [limits and scalability considerations](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_planning/rosa-limits-scalability.html) section of the OpenShift documentation. The current maximum number of pods per node is 250, but the number of pods that can fit on a node depends on the application\\'s requirements, as described in the section on planning your environment based on application requirements. If you want to scope your cluster for a specific number of pods, you can use the formula `required pods per cluster / total number of nodes = expected pods per node` to determine the minimum and maximum node count limits for autoscaling. Alternatively, you can set your autoscaling preferences for the default machine pool after it is created.'"}]
