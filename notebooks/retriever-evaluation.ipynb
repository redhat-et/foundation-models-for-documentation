    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a cutting-edge natural language processing paradigm that combines aspects of both information retrieval and language generation. In the RAG framework, a pre-trained language model, often a large transformer model, is augmented with a retrieval component. This retrieval mechanism allows the model to access external knowledge by retrieving relevant information from a set of source documents based on the input query. The integration of retrieval into the generation process enhances the model's contextual understanding and enables it to generate more informed and contextually relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RAG pattern involves two main phases: Retrieval and Augmented Generation. During Retrieval, the model identifies and retrieves pertinent information from the source documents. Subsequently, in the Augmented Generation phase, the retrieved content is utilized to enrich the generation of language, resulting in more contextually aware and coherent responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating RAG involves assessing the effectiveness of both the Retrieval and Augmented Generation components independently. In this notebook, the focus is specifically on evaluating the Retrieval part of RAG. The analysis centers on comparing two retrieval methods—similarity search and ensemble retrieval—using a source document associated with a given query. This exploration aims to provide insights into the performance and effectiveness of these retrieval techniques within the broader context of RAG pattern search."
